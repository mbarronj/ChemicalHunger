This is a collection of data and papers about the possibility of a pollutant or food ingredient that is a potential root cause of the obesity epidemic in the industrialized western world, inspired by the paper "A Chemical Hunger", a pre-print of which is included in the refrences


There are a number of writings across the internet on the subject at this time.
These will be collected in the References, but here for the moment I will post links:

Important Concepts and Questions to Investigate:
1. Cardiovascular Disease: Death from cardiovascular diseases has been declining since 1960. Has that been an increase in effectiveness of intervention, or a decrease in prevalence? 
2. Difference between obesity and overall weight?
3. Difference between effect of diet and n-6 on CVD vs Obesity
4. CVD mortality does appear to be down, Obesity does appear to be up - but beginning of trends may not be at the times thought
